# HackerRank_Solutions
This repository holds solutions to some of the hackerrank problems in languages - C++, JAVA, BASH and PYTHON

 ## - BASH
 
  Bourne again shell (Bash) is a free Unix shell that can be used in place of the Bourne shell. It is a complete implementation of       the IEEE Portable Operating System Interface for Unix (POSIX) and Open Group shell specification.

  Bash is basically a command processor that typically runs in a text window, allowing the user to type commands that cause  actions. It can read commands from a file, called a script.
  
  To get the functionality of ```Shell Scripting``` one must know some basic linux commands.
  
 ## - C++
 
   The origin of C++ dates back to 1979 when Bjarne Stroustrup, also an employee of Bell AT &T, started working on language C with classes. He borrowed desirable features from many other languages like Simula, Ada, ML, CLU and ALGOL 68. Thus, in addition to features of C language, C++ also included classes, strong type checking, default function argument and basic inheritance.
    
   ### OOPS CONCEPTS-
   
   One of the speciality of C++ was that it uses OOP's Concepts i.e Object Oriented Programming concepts which made their way for several more features. These features are:
     - Polymorphsim
     - Inheritence
     - Data Abstraction
     - Modularity
     - Encapsulation
