 ## - BASH
 
  Bourne again shell (Bash) is a free Unix shell that can be used in place of the Bourne shell. It is a complete implementation of       the IEEE Portable Operating System Interface for Unix (POSIX) and Open Group shell specification.

  Bash is basically a command processor that typically runs in a text window, allowing the user to type commands that cause  actions. It can read commands from a file, called a script.
